# Sqdle

Sqdle is an exciting new game targeted for people learning SQL. Inspired by Wordle, SQDLE offers daily SQL challenges generated using OpenAI. You get to run SQL statements directly in your browser with sql.js (powered by **SQLite3**).

### How it works

Each puzzle presents you with multiple tables filled with sample data, such as `employees`, `departments`, and `projects`. Your objective is to write an SQL query that matches the provided `target` table. Enter your SQL statements and see if they produce the expected result. Sqdle will let you know if your query matches the expected result. If it does, you win the puzzle!
