# Rough Leaderboards

A Fabric based Minecraft mod that tracks the number of certain block types a user breaks. It then reflects on an in-game leaderboard with the top players having minor buffs or rewards.

## Status

Rough Leaderboards is currently still under development with many more features to be implemented.


## Implementation

Currently using Fabric Minecraft verison 1.20.1 to implement the mod's functionalities. Will be later backported to previous versions of Minecraft.


## Features

The mod will track the count of mining a certain item like diamond and display it in an in game leaderboard. The top players will be able to avail some buffs or rewards such as boosts to mining speed and in-game materials. These will be displayed to an in-game leaderboard GUI.
